# Spam-Challenge

<h1>Objective</h1>
<p>Build a full stack app to help the reporting team handle spam tickets. The reporting team needs to be able to "Block" or "Resolve" each ticket. The data should reflect a "Block" or "Resolve" change, and the ticket should be removed from the viewable list.</p>

<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>Clone the repo</p>

<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>Run <pre>npm i</pre> inside the <b>react-node-app</b> directory. </p>
<p>Then run <pre>npm start</pre> inside the <b>react-node-app</b> directory. This will start our server!</p>

<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>Run <pre>npm i</pre> inside the <b>spam-challenge</b> directory. </p>
<p>Then run <pre>npm start</pre> inside the <b>spam-challenge</b> directory. This will start our app!</p>

<h4>Your're done!</h4>
